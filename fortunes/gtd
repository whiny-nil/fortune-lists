Almost every project could be done _better_, and an infinite quantity of information is now available that could make that happen
%
Focusing on values does _not_ simplify your life. It gives meaning and direction - and a lot more complexity.
%
Your ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to relax
%
Anything that causes you to overreact or underreact can control you, and often does.
%
Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an "open loop" pulling on your attention.
%
We need to transform all the "stuff" we're trying to organize into actionable stuff we need to do
%
Things rarely get stuck because of lack of time. They get stuck because the doing of them has not been defined.
%
There is usually an inverse proportion between how much something is on your mind and how much it's getting done.
%
There is no reason ever to have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought.
%
Review your lists as often as you need to, to get them off your mind.
%
Most people feel best about their work when they've cleaned up, closed up, clarified and renegotiated all their agreements with themselves and others. Do this weekly instead of yearly.
%
Every decision to act is an intuitive one. The challenge is to migrate from _hoping_ it's the right choice to _trusting_it's the right choice.
%
You have more to do than you can possibly do. You just need to feel good about your choices.
%
The goal is to get projects and situations off your mind, but not to lose any potentially useful ideas.
%
The most experienced planner in the world is your brain.
%
Have you envisioned wild success lately?
%
If you're waiting to have a good idea before you have any ideas, you won't have many ideas.
%
Outlines were easy, as long as you wrote the report first.
%
People love to win. If you're not totally clear about the purpose of what you are doing, you have no chance of winning.
%
Often the only way to make a hard decision is to come back to the purpose.
%
If you're not sure why you're doing something, you can never do enough of it.
%
You often need to make it up in your mind before you can make it happen in your life.
%
Your mind wants to fill in the blanks between here and there, but in somewhat random order.
%
A good way to find out what something might be is to uncover all the things it's probably not.
%
A "project plan" identifies the smaller outcomes, which can then be naturally planned.
%
If the project is still on your mind, there's more planning to do.
%
You need no new skills to increase your productivity - just a new set of behaviours about when and where to apply them.
%
You increase your productivity and creativity exponentially when you think about the right things at the right time and have the tools to capture your value-added thinking.
%
Dedicate two days to this process, and it will be worth many times more than that in terms of your productivity and mental health.
%
You must have a focused work space - at home, at work, and if possible even in transit.
%
It is critical that you have your _own_ space.  You want to _use_ your systems, not just think about them.
%
Moment-to-moment collecting, thinking, processing, and organizing are challenging enough; always ensure that you have the tools to make them as easy as possible.
%
Once you know how to process your stuff and what to organize, you really just need to create and manage lists.
%
One of the best tricks for enhancing your personal productivity is having organizing tools that you love to use.
%
If your filing system isn't fast, functional and _fun_, you'll resist the whole process.
%
In the fire zone of real work, if it takes longer than sixty seconds to file something, you won't file, you'll stack.
%
Train yourself to notice and collect anything that doesn't belong where it is forever.
%
Consider whether your collectible and nostalgia items are still meaningful to you.
%
Don't let the "not so important" trap gnaw away your energy at home.
%
Connection is completed when you can easily see the edges to the inventory of everything that is completed.
%
"Process" does not mean "spend time on."
%
The in-basket is a processing station, not a storage bin.
%
When in doubt, throw it out.
When in doubt, keep it.
%
Until you know what the next physical action is, there's still more thinking required before anything can happen.
%
Determine what you need to _do_ in order to _decide_.
%
The two minute rule is magic.
%
You'll be surprised how many two-minute actions you can perform even on your most critical projects.
%
Right now you probably have between thirty and a hundred projects.
%
Airtight organization is required for your focus to remain on the broader horizon.
%
The categories must be kept visually, physically, and psychologically separate.
%
The calendar should show only the "hard landscape" around which you do the rest of your actions.
%
Think carefully about _where_ and _how_ you can and can't do _which_ actions, and organize your lists accordingly.
%
Standing meetings and people you deal with on an ongoing basis may need their own "Agenda" lists.
%
Keep actionable email and paper separated from all the rest.
%
It requires much less energy to maintain email at a zero base than at a thousand base.
%
"Out of sight, out of mind" is not really out of mind.
%
A complete and current "Projects" list is the major operational tool for moving from tree-hugging to forest management.
%
How you list projects and subprojects is up to you; just be sure you know where to find all the moving parts.
%
There is no need ever to lose an idea about a project, theme or topic.
%
Your filing system should be a simple library of data, easily retrievable - not your reminder for actions, projects, priorities or prospects.
%
If material is purely for reference, the only issue is whether it's worth the time and space required to keep it.
%
Someday/Maybe's are not throwaway items. They may be some of the most interesting and creative things you'll ever get involved with.
%
It's OK to decide not to decide - as long as you have a decide-not-to-decide system.
%
Checklists can be highly useful to let you know what you _don't_ need to be concerned about.
%
A few seconds a day is usually all you need for review, as long as you are looking at the right things at the right time.
%
You will invariably take in more opportunities than your system can process on a daily basis.
%
Your best thoughts about work won't happen while you're at work.
%
Ultimately and always you must trust your intuition. There are many things you can do, however, that can increase that trust.
%
There is no reason not to be highly productive, even when you're not in top form.
%
It is impossible to feel good about your choices unless you are clear about what your work really is.
%
It is often easier to get wrapped up in the urgent demands of the moment than deal with your in-basket, email and the rest of your open loops.
%
Do ad hoc work as it shows up, not because it is the path of least resistance, but because it is the thing you need to do, vis-a-vis all the rest.
%
You're never lacking in opportunities to clarify your priorities at any level.  Pay attention to which horizon is calling you.
%
Trying to manage from the top down, when the bottom is out of control, may be the _least_ effective approach.
%
Taking the inventory of your current work at all levels will automatically produce greater focus, alignment, and sense of priorities.
%
If you're not totally sure what your job is, it will always feel overwhelming.
%
When you're not sure what you're doing, you'll never know when enough is enough.
%
You need to set up systems and tricks that get you to think about your projects and situations more frequently, more easily, and in more depth.
%
One of the greatest blocks to organizational productivity is the lack of decision by a senior person about the necessity of a meeting, and with whom, to move an important issue forward.
%
Function follows form. Give yourself a context for capturing thoughts, and thoughts will occur that you don't yet know you have.
%
Where is your closest pad?  Keep it closer.
%
Leverage your computer as a think station.
%
If you don't have a good system for filing bad ideas, you probably don't have one for filing good ones, either.
%
Clear the deck, create a context, and do some creative project thinking. You'll then be way ahead of most people.
%
The sense of anxiety and guilt doesn't come from having too much to do; it's the automatic result of breaking agreements with yourself.
%
Maintaining an objective inventory of your work makes it much easier to say no with integrity.
%
It's a lot easier to complete agreements when you know what they are.
%
Bailing water in a leaky boat diverts energy from rowing the boat.
%
Organizations must create a culture in which it is acceptable that everyone has more to do than he or she can do, and in which it is sage to re-negotiate agreements about what everyone is doing.
%
When a culture adopts "What's the next action?" as a standard operating query, there's an automatic increase in energy, productivity, clarity, and focus.
%
Without a next action, there remains a potentially infinite gap between current reality and what you need to do.
%
Bright people have the capability of freaking out faster and more dramatically than anyone else.
%
Ceasing negative imaging will always cause your energy to increase.
%
Everything on your lists and in your stacks is either attractive or repulsive to you - there's no neutral ground when it comes to your stuff.
%
Avoiding action decisions until the pressure of the last minute creates huge inefficiencies and unnecessary stress.
%
Productivity will improve only when individuals increase their operational responsiveness.  And in knowledge work, that means clarifying actions on the front end instead of the back.
%
Defining specific projects and next actions that address real quality-of-life issues is productivity at its best.
%
We are constantly creating and fulfilling.
%
The challenge is to marry high-level idealistic focus to the mundane activity of life.  In the end they require the same thinking.
