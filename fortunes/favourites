BIG HINT: No perceived difference, no sale. BIGGER HINT: No perceived value, no sale. BIGGEST HINT: If you are calling and not leaving a message, it's because you have nothing of value to say."

What bears fruit is the continuity of your best effort over time.  The quality of your work from moment to moment or day to day will vary, but if you do your best every time, you will get your best results.

"I say to you, this morning, that if you have never found something so dear and precious to you that you will die for it, then you aren't fit to live. You may be 38 years old, as I happen to be, and one day, some great opportunity stands before you and calls upon you to stand for some great principle, some great issue, some great cause. And you refuse to do it because you are afraid. You refuse to do it because you want to live longer. You're afraid that you will lose your job, or you are afraid that you will be criticized or that you will lose your popularity, or you're afraid that somebody will stab or shoot or bomb your house. So you refuse to take a stand. Well, you may go on and live until you are ninety, but you are just as dead at 38 as you would be at ninety. And the cessation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit.
You died when you refused to stand up for right.
You died when you refused to stand up for truth.
You died when you refused to stand up for justice."

"We are free to take a step...and then to rescind or expand the step.  We are in fact free to do almost anything we wish - except to avoid the issue or deny the freedom.  We stand in a place of aches and wonders, with few discernible absolutes besides the necessity to choose and our evolving conviction that it is wrong to use a person as a thing.  We can dare to walk upon this ground of dubious footing, because we are holding one another up as best we can, and because it is we ourselves and not some deterministic logic that writes our civil laws.  We can permit free speech and prosecute libel.  We can maintain a military and foreswear militarism.  We can, with all due respect to ethicists who claim we can do no such thing, allow abortion and disallow infanticide, and we can do so for the simple reason that it seems like the best thing to do.  We can sniff out our options and pick and choose amoung them, a birthright generally less appreciated by a dogmatist than a dog."
